# Cat Clicker Project
Class assignment for Udacity
## Description
A simple web site that displays a list of cats along with one cat picture at a time, and records clicks. The learning objective is to solve design and execution problems with Javascript and to organize the code according to 1) data model, 2) code for rendering the display and 3) an 'excahnge' (or octopus) connecting these two.

The initial project is in `cat-clicker.html` which access `js/cat.js`. A newer version, in `cat-clicker2.html` accesses `js/cat2.js` and makes use of Knockout (`knockout-3.4.0.js`) to bind functions to the html and make the js simpler.
## Install the project
Clone this repository. Run the project by opening the `.html` file. Find the `.js` file in the same directory.
